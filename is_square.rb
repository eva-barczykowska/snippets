# A square of squares
# You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares.
# And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!
#
# However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up
# with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know,
# whether you're currently working in vainâ€¦ Wait! That's it! You just have to check
# if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.
#
# Task
# Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:
#
# In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is
# the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
#
# The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that
# in dynamic typed languages.

# x has to be greated than -1 so that it's possible for the square to be real:)

p is_square?(4) #== true, "4 is a perfect square (2 * 2)"
p is_square?(25) #== true, "25 is a perfect square (5 * 5)"
